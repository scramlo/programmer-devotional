### Devotional Body
Consistency among the devotionals can be achieved by implementing a common format. Please, to the best of your ability write your devotional body according to the following pattern.:

> 1. Hook: An excellent lead and a compelling anecdote will grab and hold (hook) the readerâ€™s attention.
> 2. Book: Point them to the wisdom of the Bible (book).
> 3. Look: Offer some unique way of seeing (look) how the Bible relates to his or her needs.
> 4. Took: Finally, provide takeaway (took) value.

These four sections should not be denoted or parsed, they are a general guideline to create consistency.

        "body": "<p>In web development there is a principle called \"convention over configuration\" It means if you code according to the pattern (or convention) suggested by the framework you are using, everything will automagically work. This is different than configuring every piece of code to work with other pieces.</p><p>When Jesus taught, His words left little room for hanging on to other frameworks. What He said was difficult to accept for some, but for those who did receive His words everything all made sense in the end. Peter had the right idea declaring \"Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words that give eternal life\" Even if he didn't understand the \"why\" or \"how\" behind Jesus' teachings, he trusted the \"who\"</p><p>As an Evangelical Christian, I have accepted a framework. This is different than some people attempt their philosophy of life. For these people, everything one believes should be tested and approved by their personal canon (configuration). But, not me. Even if I don't know how it works that when I forgive, bless, and pray for my enemies, life is better--it automagically works.</p>",
        "thesis": "Even if you don't understand the \"why\" or \"how\", when you take Jesus at His word your life will automagically be blessed.",
        "prayer": "Lord Jesus, I may not always understand \"why\" You have called us to some things in life or \"how\" they will result in Your glory and our good, but I trust that when I follow everything you teach it will all work out."
