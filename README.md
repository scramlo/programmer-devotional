### Devotional Body
Consistency among the devotionals can be achieved by implementing a common format. Please, to the best of your ability write your devotional body according to the following pattern.:

> 1. Hook: An excellent lead and a compelling anecdote will grab and hold (hook) the readerâ€™s attention.
> 2. Book: Point them to the wisdom of the Bible (book).
> 3. Look: Offer some unique way of seeing (look) how the Bible relates to his or her needs.
> 4. Took: Finally, provide takeaway (took) value.

These four sections should not be denoted or parsed, they are a general guideline to create consistency.
