        "body": "<p>In web development there is a principle called \"convention over configuration\" It means if you code according to the pattern (or convention) suggested by the framework you are using, everything will automagically work. This is different than configuring every piece of code to work with other pieces.</p><p>When Jesus taught, His words left little room for hanging on to other frameworks. What He said was difficult to accept for some, but for those who did receive His words everything all made sense in the end. Peter had the right idea declaring \"Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words that give eternal life\" Even if he didn't understand the \"why\" or \"how\" behind Jesus' teachings, he trusted the \"who\"</p><p>As an Evangelical Christian, I have accepted a framework. This is different than some people attempt their philosophy of life. For these people, everything one believes should be tested and approved by their personal canon (configuration). But, not me. Even if I don't know how it works that when I forgive, bless, and pray for my enemies, life is better--it automagically works.</p>",
